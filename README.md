# Suri-Aral: AI-Powered Item Analysis Tool

Suri-Aral (a combination of Filipino words "Suri" for analyze and "Aral" for study) is a standalone, browser-based web application designed to help educators perform detailed item analysis on test results. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to provide not just quantitative data but also qualitative insights and actionable recommendations, turning raw scores into a powerful tool for improving instruction.

The entire application runs from a single `index.html` file, requiring no server-side setup or installation.
